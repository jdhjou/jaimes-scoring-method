This repository implements a golf scoring methodology.

Rules:
- Lost balls always count as +2 strokes
- Putting strokes lost = max(0, putts - 2)
- GIR must never be replaced; new metrics must be additive
- Scoring logic must be explainable and measurable
- Prefer trendable metrics over single-round heuristics
- Avoid UI churn unless explicitly requested
